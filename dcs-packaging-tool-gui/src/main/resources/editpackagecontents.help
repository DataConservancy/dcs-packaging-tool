This page allows you to modify the types, properties, and content of package resources, subject to the constraints of the the domain profile in the context of surrounding resources. Changes to a resource are initiated via its Actions menu, which is activated by clicking its Actions icon (vertical ellipses). The Actions menu may be divided into up to three sections. The top section appears if the resource is not ignored. Clicking “Properties” opens the properties window, providing the opportunity to modify both domain and user-defined properties. Selecting “Add file” or “Add folder" initiates a selection dialog in order to map the file system object into a member resource. Choosing “Refresh” checks the file system for changes and offers the option of accepting the changes into the current set of package resources. The middle section of the Actions menu is visible if there is currently another available type for the resource and the resource is not ignored. Clicking the an available type converts the resource to that type. If the type is preceded by an exclamation mark icon, then some properties of the original type will be lost in the transformation. Finally, the bottom section displays the “Ignore” status of the resource. Some resources will be ignored automatically when added to the package contents. Clicking on “Ignored” toggles the ignored status. An ignored resource does not impose contextual constraints on other resources in the domain model; and its underlying bitstream, if it exists, will not be included when a package is generated.
        • Additionally, there are two checkboxes that control the display of information on this page. When selected, “Show full package resource paths” causes the display of the full path for each resource. When it is not selected, the path displayed for each resource is relative to its parent. When “Show ignored nodes” is selected, ignored resources are visible. This is especially useful if you wish to stop ignoring one or more nodes.
        • You may save your package state and continue working on this page by clicking the “Save” button; clicking the “Save & Next” button will advance you to the next screen, where you can you can generate a package.
