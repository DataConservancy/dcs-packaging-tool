This page provides options for opening an existing package. To do so, a package state file or archive (e.g., TAR, Zip) format package file may be selected in the “Select a package file” box OR an exploded package directory may be selected in the “Select an exploded package” box. When a package file is selected, an extraction directory must be specified in the second box. Clicking the “Continue” button will advance you to the Basic Information page, where you can make changes and save a new package state file.
