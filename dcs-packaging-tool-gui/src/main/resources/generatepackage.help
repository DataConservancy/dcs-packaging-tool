This page allows you to specify parameters for package generation and the location of the resultant package. A cluster of circular radio buttons indicate a choice of a single option. A cluster of squared off checkboxes indicates that multiple choices are allowed. Selecting the "exploded” archive format will result in a package directory hierarchy that is written on the file system without being wrapped in a Zip or TAR file; either of the other choices will result in the creation of a package file. Manifests will be generated for each of the selected checksum algorithms. At least one checksum algorithm must be selected. Stored in each package is an RDF linked data graph that captures the relationships and properties associated with each resource. The graph serialization format specifies the syntax used to store this graph data. Clicking the “Finish” button invokes package generation, which should result in a package being stored in the Package Output Directory.
