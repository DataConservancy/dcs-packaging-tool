Here you can manage basic information related to your package. Ifyou are creating a new package, you will also select a domain profile, which specifies the classes or types (e.g., collections, items, metadata files) that may be assigned to the resources in this package. The screen is divided vertically into sections with required, recommended, and optional fields. As you enter information into fields, you will receive feedback on the validity of your input: a green check mark indicates a valid value, while a red ‘X’ indicates an invalid one. You may save your package state and continue working on this page by clicking the “Save” button; however, you must provide valid values for all required fields before clicking the “Save & Next” button will advance you to the next screen. Once you save and move to the next screen, it will no longer be possible to change the domain profile without beginning the create new package process all over again.
