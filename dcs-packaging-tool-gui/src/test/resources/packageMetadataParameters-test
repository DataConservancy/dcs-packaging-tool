# Here is the complete list of package level parameters.
# Package-Name [Required]
# Contact-Name	[Recommended]
# Contact-Phone	[Recommended]
# Contact-Email	[Recommended]
# Keyword	[Optional, Repeatable] A keyword string.
# External-Identifier	[Optional] Sender-provided Identifier of the package. There should be a one-to-one mapping between the
#    External-Identifier and the Bag-Group-Identifier.
# External-Description	[Optional] Description of A brief explanation of the contents and provenance.
# Internal-Sender-Identifier	[Optional, Repeatable] An alternate sender-specific identifier for the content and/or bag.
# Internal-Sender-Description [Optional] A sender-local prose description of the contents of the bag.
# Source-Organization	[Optional]
# Organization-Address	[Optional]
# Bag-Count	[Recommended] Sequence number of a given bag within a bag group. The format is "<n> of <m>", where <n> is the sequence number
#    within the group and <m> is the total number of bags in the group. If the latter is not known, the value of <m> should be '?'.
#    "Bag-Count: 1 of 1" should be specified if the entire package will be captured in a single bag. This mechanism allows a package to be
#    split across multiple bags.
# Bag-Group-Identifier	[Recommended] A sender-provided identifier for a bag group. For DCS packages, the bag group identifier should
#    uniquely identify a package and when combined with the sequence number ('<n>') from the Bag-Count should uniquely identify a bag.
# Rights-String	[Optional] A rights/use statement.
# Rights-URI	[Optional, Repeatable] A URI representing rights/use information.
# Bagging-Date	[Recommended, generated by tools]
# Bag-Size	[Recommended, generated by tools] The size or approximate size of the bag, intended primarily for human consumption. -
# Payload-Oxum: [Recommended, generated by tools] The "octetstream sum" of the payload directory, in the format "<octetcount>.<streamcount>" (number-of-bytes.number-of-files).

# This file is intended only to inform the GUI about whether properties are Required (Q), Recommended (M) or Optional (O), and
# Whether they are repeatable (X) or editable (E). Several modifiers may be comma separated in the values below [e.g. O,X or M,X,E]. Q, M and O are supposed to be mutually exclusive
# with O < M < Q. If specified jointly the "largest" value will take precedence. Fittingly, the O flag is optional.
# Parameters which are generated by tools do not need to be represented here since the user will not need to input them in the GUI.
# The parameters will appear in the GUI in the order they are presented here.
