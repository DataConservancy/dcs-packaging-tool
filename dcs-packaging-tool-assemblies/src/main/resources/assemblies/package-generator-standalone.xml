    This assembly produces a jar that includes all of the dependencies 
    of the package generator.  When the Maven assembly plugin is properly 
    configured (that is, the <archiver> is configured to add the 
    proper manifest entries to the jar), this assembly will result
    in a stand-alone jar that can be executed using:
      java -jar <jarfile>

    Unfortunately, the <id> of the assembly affects a number of things, including the filenames
    of the generated assemblies; the <id> is also used as the artifact classifier for the
    assembly, and is used when attaching the assembly to the Maven project.
